# Hi, it is Tushar
I am basically interested in machine learning, computer vision, image processing, computer architecture

## Examples of Projects

**Peanut Maturity Classification from hyperspectral image:** Segmenting Peanut from background and identify all different peanuts using k-means classification and then classify the maturity of the peanut maturity from the spectral characteristics of hyperspectral image using logistic regression, support vector machine and random forest classifier <br><br>
**Coin Detection using hough circle transformation:** Coin detection, diameter measurement and coin counting using hough circle transformation. Here, redundant coins are suppressed using minimum distance between the center of those detected coins.<br>
<br>
**Emotion recognition from text:** Preprocessing amazon movie review text file with word embedding and word2vec model to create the feature vector and classify the sentiment of the review by Naive Bayes and Random Forest classifier.<br>
<br>
**MATLAB based sensor coverage visualization:** Visualization of the coverage of a sensor network for tracking with the change of angle and position of the sensors.<br>
<br>
**Digital Lock Design:** Designing a digital lock using gate circuit<br>
<br>

## Competions
