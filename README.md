# Hi, it is Tushar
I am basically interested in machine learning, computer vision, image processing, computer architecture

## Machine Learning Projects

**Pedestrian Detection and Distance Measurement: (MS Thesis):** Details will be uploaded after publication.

**Peanut Maturity Classification from hyperspectral image:** Segmenting Peanut from background and identify all different peanuts using k-means classification and then classify the maturity of the peanut maturity from the spectral characteristics of hyperspectral image using logistic regression, support vector machine and random forest classifier. <br><br>
**Emotion recognition from text:** Preprocessing amazon movie review text file with word embedding and word2vec model to create the feature vector and classify the sentiment of the review by Naive Bayes and Random Forest classifier. <br>
<br>
**Weather forecasting model:** Forcast weather based on support vector machine and random forest classifier.

## Image Processing and Signal Processing Projects

**Coin Detection using hough circle transformation:** Coin detection, diameter measurement and coin counting using hough circle transformation. Here, redundant coins are suppressed using minimum distance between the center of those detected coins. <br>
<br>
**Chlorophyll determination from wheat leaf**: Leaf was first segmented from background and then the average L,a,b color indexes of all leaves was calculated. Lastly, Linear regression is used to map chlorophyll with a* and b*. {https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332586475_A_Lowcost_Image_Processing_Based_Technique_to_Estimate_Chlorophyll_in_Winter_Wheat}<br> 
<br>
**MATLAB based sensor coverage visualization:** Visualization of the coverage of a sensor network for tracking with the change of angle and position of the sensors. 
<br><br>
**Matching Leaf with LCC based on correlation coefficient:** Take pearson correlation coefficient of a rice leaf with all 4 strips Leaf Color Chart provided by BARRI (Bangladesh Rice Research Institute) to figure out the fertilization requirements. 
<br>
<br>
**Design of FIR filter:** Design efficient FIR filter for noise removal from recorded voice signal.
